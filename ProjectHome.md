When provided with a fuzzed file, a corresponding original un-fuzzed file, and the path to the targeted program, FuzzDiff will selectively "un-fuzz" portions of the fuzzed file while re-launching the application to monitor for crashes.  This will yield a file that still crashes the target application, but contains a minimum set of changes from the original, un-fuzzed file.  This can be useful in pinning down the exact cause of a crash.
